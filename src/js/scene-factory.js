// The Lightning Factory: a Lightning node at work, shown as a factory in a tiered cavern behind the 2 o'clock
// mouth, run by gorillas in hard hats. Everything that moves is driven by the node's event stream through
// `factory-feed.js`; until a real node publishes, `factory-mock.js` plays a demo node, and the entrance says so.
//
// What each station shows, and what it may not (Foundry's consumer rules, docs/lightning-factory.md):
// - The node core glows while the node runs and goes dark when it says it stopped.
// - Four featured lines stand on the main and high levels, each with two capacitors: blue lights on a settled
//   forward, orange sputters on a failed one. A forward's sats ride inside the glass conduits: in along the line it
//   came in on, through the core, and out along the line it left by, when the event names that line (the demo
//   contract's `out`; Foundry's public events name one line only, and then the sats only go in). A failed forward's
//   sats reach the core and come back, glowing red, and the line they were bound for sputters. A large forward is a
//   stream of sats and a surge through the node: the chamber flares white, rings of light climb it and the Tesla
//   coils arc to it.
// - The on-chain forge fires when a line is opened or closed; its bay's lantern turns red while it is taken down. An
//   opening sends carts of sats up the left shaft from the chain for the forge to consume; a close has it mint a coin
//   that rolls back down the right shaft. The carts count the opening's bucketed size, never an amount.
// - The switchboard's screens light with every forward; its board carries the node's own counts and
//   Foundry's hourly summary, which is labelled as Foundry's.
// - The rebalancer spins for a rebalance, and never touches a line.
// - The treasury's gold is the node's public capacity; its belt carries each of the demo node's fees to the crate.
// - The watchtower's beam sweeps while the feed is live and goes dark when it falls silent: that is "no
//   signal", which is not the same as the node stopping.
// - The galleries under the vault hold the lines past the featured four; the study hall is locked for now.
//
// The first view stands on the entrance balcony and looks across at the core, the way the concept frames it.
// Escape, the Leave button and the tunnel behind the balcony all go back to the island.
